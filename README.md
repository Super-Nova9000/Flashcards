This is the ReadMe file for the flashcards program, this program randomises cards put into a file and asks
you for the answer. A score is not recorded in this, and the program will not confirm if you're right or
wrong, it will only display the correct answer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Instructions**

1) Get your set of "cards" and paste them into the same folder as the program.
2) Launch the program, and tell it the name of the file (Program only tested using .txt files)
      - If using a legacy set of cards, you will be asked how many cards are in the deck
3) The program will then randomise through the cards you have provided. Make sure all information in step 2
   is correct, otherwise the program will skip questions or return blank spaces.
4) When you're done, type "Q" (case sensitive) into the answer box, and it will quit the program, as well
   as closing any active files.

Changing the active card pack requires the program to be restarted.
